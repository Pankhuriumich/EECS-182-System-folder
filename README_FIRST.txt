Welcome to EECS 182.

To get started, first do the following:

Open "me's Home" from the desktop by double-clicking it, if not
already open. This is your home folder. "me" is your username.

Double-Click on "updateSystem.sh". You will get a dialog box that
warns you that it is an executable text file. Select "Run in
Terminal...". The window will close automatically.

A file "viewme.py" should be there at this point. Double-click
that. It should open the file in an editor called "emacs". Follow the
instructions in the file.
