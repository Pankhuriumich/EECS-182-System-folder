# This file, with a .py extension, contains a python program
# Lines that start with the hash sign are ignored by Python. They are
# used for comments.

# Step 1: To run this program, in a terminal window, type "python2.5
# first_program.py" (at the bottom of the screen do: Menu->Terminal). You can
# open a different terminal window if your first window is running the
# emacs command.

# If you're editing this file in emacs, and you see a split windown
# and want to get rid of it, go to the menus at the top, File ->
# Remove Splits

def hello():
    print "-----------------------------------------------------"
    print "Welcome to EECS 182"
    print "I hope you enjoy the class."
    print "Practice using the emacs editor with this file"
    print "-----------------------------------------------------"
    print "\n"   	# print a newline to create a blank line


hello()
print "\n .... Let's say that again...  \n"
hello()

# Step 2: Now, Try deleting the second hello() (or just adding # at
# the beginning of its line, to comment it out. Save the file.  Run
# the program again to see the results.  Try control-f (forward),
# control-n (next), control-p (previous), control-b (back) control-v
# (view one screen forward), esc-v or alt-v (one screen back) to
# practice navigating around the screen using keyboard shortcuts.

# Note: If something strange occurs that you don't like, hit
# control-g. That tells emacs to quit what it was doing. If that
# doesn't work, hit the ESC key 3 times.

# Step 3: Now, insert "hello()" back into the editor buffer below this
# line.  Save the file. Run python2.5 to see the results. You will
# notice that as you are typing the letters of "hello", the editor
# presents you auto-complete choices. Some of the the choices other
# than the word "hello" are in-built python variables. You will find
# this convenient later.

# Step 4: Now, let's try the undo features of the emacs editor. Invoke
# undo from the menu. There is a keyboard short-cut for that too, but
# it is probably easier from the menu. You can repeatedly do this to
# keep undoing stuff.

# Step 5: Now, try a Python program that uses variables. Uncomment the
# lines below, and fill in values for width, height, length, and you.

# width = 0
# height = 0
# length = 0
# me = "<your name here>"
# print "Volume = ", width*height*length
# print "My name is", me


# You can get by with just that much knowledge of the keyboard
# commands in emacs, plus extensive use of the menus at the top. But
# if you're willing to invest an hour or two in really learning to use
# the editor, you'll find it will pay great dividends later. Try
# Running Help -> Emacs Tutorial

# There is a lot more to learn, such as running Python from within
# emacs, etc.  But this is a good start!
