# Python. Problem 1.
# Python uses the pound sign for comments. Anything after the pound symbol
# is ignored by the Python interpreter.

# Task 1: Put your name on the line below
# Name: xxxxxxxxxxxx

# Task 2: Run the program as follows from a terminal window. You should get Hello World 
# printed out. 
# % python p1.py

# Task 3: Modify the following line using emacs so that it prints out "Go Wolverines!" instead
# of "Hello World"

print "Hello World"

# Submit the modified p1.py (it should have this name) and a screenshot that shows it produces
# the correct output when run in the Python interpreter.
