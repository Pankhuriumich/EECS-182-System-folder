To autograde your program partially, run the following within Mint or on a CAEN Linux machine 
by logging to vnc.engin.umich.edu. This only grades extract.cpp and printmovieitem.cpp. Other files 
are graded manually. Your program files must be in the current directory.

% sh grademyprogram.sh | more


The program may output some HTML, which you can ignore.  Hit Space key to page through 
the output. The autograder is basically testing your program on a couple of movies, comparing
your solution to a reference solution.
