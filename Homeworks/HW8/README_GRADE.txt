To run the auto-grader, do the following:

% sh grade.sh

Watch for any error messages from the autog-grading script.
If everything is successful, you should see a file GRADE.txt appear in the current
folder. Examine the content of that file. Here is the sample perfect score for
the auto-graded part of the code:

ratings	10
emptysearch	3
multisearch	7
gradeextract.out	5

Other points are assigned manually. The above scores may be adjusted manually if we
notice problems that the autograder did not catch.

The manual points include:
- Examining the scatter plot and reading your assessment
- Coding style points
- Whether you appear to have adequately tested your code by having some test
  functions of your own
- Screenshots
- Any other intangibles
