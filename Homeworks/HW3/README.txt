Please follow the instructions in timeconverter.cpp and timeconverter.py.
You are solving identical problems in both C++ and Python. Chances are that once you complete one problem, it should take very little time to do the other. So, focus on one language first, whichever you find easier.

If you find any syntax errors in the programs, do fix them. It is part of the
homework!
