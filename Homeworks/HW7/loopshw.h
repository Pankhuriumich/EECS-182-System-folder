// Write functions to compute the following things 

// Computes average of values in array A that is of size n.
double average(int A[], int n);


// Compute average of values in array A (that is of size n) for
// values that are between 0 and 100 (inclusive). 
// The average is computed by adding up values between
// 0 and 100 and dividing by the number of such values.
// The function should return -1 if there are no values between 0 and 100.
// See test_average_validrange() in main.cpp for some additional
// examples. 
double average_validrange(int A[], int n);



// Computes the maximum values in array A of size n.
int maximum(int A[], int n);
